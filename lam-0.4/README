LAM - Readme
============

  A set of PHP-scripts to administrate Unix and Samba accounts in a LDAP server.
  LAM runs on any webserver with PHP4 support and connects to your LDAP server
  unencrypted or via SSL.
  The application manages accounts for users, groups and Samba hosts in
  multiple organizational units. LAM supports the Samba 2.x schema and the
  Samba 3 schema.

  Requirements:
    PHP4
    Openldap (2.0 or greater)
    A web-browser that supports CSS (Netscape 4.x is not recommended)

  Summary:
    With LAM you can easily manage user, group and machine accounts stored in
    a LDAP server over a web interface. At the moment it supports:

      - displaying the user/group/host/domain entries
      - deleting entries
      - adding new entries
      - editing entries
      - filtering and sorting
      - account profiles
      - access management
      - multiple configuration profiles
      - OU Editor
      - User creation via file upload
      - Samba 2 and 3 schema support

  Important:
    The standard password to edit the configuration options is "lam".

  Download:
    You can get the newest version at http://sourceforge.net/projects/lam/

  Installation:
    Please see the INSTALL file.

  Known Bugs:
    - If you fill in the Unix workstations field the LDAP add/modify operation
      may fail. This is because the host attribute is provided only by
      objectClass account which conflicts with inetOrgPerson.
      If you want to use host restrictions, add the host attribute to
      inetOrgPerson in your schema file.

  Documentation:
    Basic documentation available in /docs

  Internationalization:
    If you want to use a translated version of LAM be sure to install the
    needed locales. See locale/ for a list of supported locales.
    Debian users can add locales with "dpkg-reconfigure locales".

  Security:
    It is strongly recommended to use a SSL connection to your web server.

    LAM needs to store your LDAP username + password in the session. The session
    files are saved in sess/ and are accessible only by the web server. To increase
    security username and password are encrypted with AES (256 bit). The key and iv
    are generated at random when you log in. They are stored in two cookies.
 

    Have fun!
