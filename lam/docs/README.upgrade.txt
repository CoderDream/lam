0.4.x -> 0.5.0:
===============

There were some major changes since 0.4.x.

First enter the LAM configuration editor and check if all settings are correct. Since
LAM now supports a plugin architecture for all accounts you can select the needed
modules. Click on "Edit modules" and select which account types you want to manage.
Depending on which modules you selected there might be more configuration options.

Now save your settings and login to LAM. You will have to recreate all your account
profiles because the format changed. The profile editor can be found on the tools
page ("Tools" in the upper left corner).

The tools page also includes the new flexible file upload and the PDF editor.
You can specify yourself which attributes should show up in the PDF files. There
are also different PDF profiles possible.
