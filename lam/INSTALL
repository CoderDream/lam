Installation Instructions for LAM
---------------------------------


1. Requirements

   - Apache webserver (SSL optional) with PHP module (PHP 5 (>= 5.1) with
     ldap, gettext, xml and optional mcrypt)
   - some LAM plugins may require additional PHP extensions (you will get a
     note on the login page if something is missing)
   - Perl (optional, needed only for lamdaemon)
   - OpenLDAP (>2.0)
   - A web browser :-)

   MCrypt will be used to store your LDAP password encrypted in the session file.


   See docs/README.schema.txt for information about used LDAP schema files.


2. Installation

   1. Extract package with:
      tar xzf ldap-account-manager-<version>.tar.gz


   2. Install the files

   2a. Copy the files into the html-file scope of the webserver. For example
       /apache/htdocs.

       Set appropriate file permissions:
        - lam/sess: write permission for apache user
        - lam/tmp: write permission for apache user
        - lam/config (with subdirectories): write permission for apache user
        - lam/lib: lamdaemon.pl must be set executable (See also
          docs/readme.lamdeamon.txt)

   2b. You can also use the included configure script to install LAM. See
       "./configure --help" for a list of install options.


   3. Configure config.cfg and create a configuration profile.
      Copy config.cfg_sample to config.cfg and set the master password and default
      profile.

      Open the index.html in your web browser:
       - Follow the link "Configuration Login" from the start page.
        (The default password to edit the options is "lam")
       - Select the default lam profile or create a new profile.
       - Change the settings to fit your environment.



3. Setting up PHP

   LAM runs with PHP5 (>= 5.1).

   Needed changes in your php.ini:

    * memory_limit = 64M
