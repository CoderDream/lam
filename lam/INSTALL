Installation Instructions for LAM
---------------------------------


1. Requirements

   - Apache webserver (SSL optional) with installed PHP-Module (PHP-Module with
     ldap, gettext, mcrypt, openldap)
   - Perl
   - Openldap (>2.0)
   - A web browser :-)


2. Installation

   * Extract package with:
     tar xzf lam-version.tar.gz

   * Copy files into the html-file scope of the webserver. For example
     /apache/htdocs.

   * Set appropriate file permissions for /lam/sess and /lam/config (with subdirectories).
     Both directories must have write permissions set for the specified apache
     web user. The perl files in /lam/lib must be set executable. (See also
     docs/readme.lamdeamon.pl)

   * Configure config.cfg and create a configuration profile.
     Copy config.cfg_sample to config.cfg and set the master password and default
     profile.
     Then use the web interface with the link "Configuration Login" (start file is /lam/index.html)
     or configure LAM manually. (The default password to edit the options is "lam")

     - Manually:
       A default config file can be found in /lam/config/lam.conf_sample.
       Change the necessary entries and rename it to /lam/config/lam.conf.
