Installation Instructions for LAM
---------------------------------


1. Requirements

   - Apache webserver (SSL optional) with installed PHP-Module (PHP-Module with
     ldap, gettext, xml, mcrypt+mhash optional)
   - Perl (optional, needed only for lamdaemon)
   - OpenLDAP (>2.0)
   - A web browser :-)

   MHash is only needed if you use PHP < 4.3 and want to use SHA or SSHA
   for password hashes.
   MCrypt will be used to store your LDAP password encrypted in the session file.

   Getting mcrypt and mhash for Suse/RedHat:

   Either you compile PHP4 yourself or you use some unofficial packages:

   - Suse: ftp://ftp.suse.com/pub/people/poeml/mod_php4
   - RedHat: http://ftp.horde.org/pub/RPMS


   See docs/README.schema.txt for information about used LDAP schema files.


2. Installation

   * Extract package with:
     tar xzf ldap-account-manager_<version>.tar.gz

   * Copy files into the html-file scope of the webserver. For example
     /apache/htdocs.

   * Set appropriate file permissions:
     - lam/sess: write permission for apache user
     - lam/tmp: write permission for apache user
     - lam/config (with subdirectories): write permission for apache user
     - lam/lib: lamdaemon.pl must be set executable (See also
       docs/readme.lamdeamon.txt)

   * Configure config.cfg and create a configuration profile.
     Copy config.cfg_sample to config.cfg and set the master password and default
     profile.

     Open the index.html in your web browser:
     - Follow the link "Configuration Login" from the start page.
       (The default password to edit the options is "lam")
     - Select the default lam profile or create a new profile.
     - Change the settings to fit your environment.



3. Setting up PHP

   LAM runs with PHP4 or PHP5.

   Needed changes in your php.ini:

    * memory_limit = 32M
