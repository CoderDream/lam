LAM - Readme
============

  LDAP Account Manager (LAM) manages user, group and host accounts in an LDAP
  directory. LAM runs on any webserver with PHP4/5 support and connects to your
  LDAP server unencrypted or via SSL/TLS.
  Currently LAM supports these account types: Samba 2 and 3, Unix, Kolab 2,
  address book entries, NIS mail aliases and MAC addresses. There is a tree
  viewer included to allow access to the raw LDAP attributes. You can use
  templates for account creation and use multiple configuration profiles.
  LAM is translated to Catalan, Chinese (Traditional + Simplified), Czech,
  Dutch, English, French, German, Hungarian, Italian, Japanese, Russian and
  Spanish.

  Summary:
    With LAM you can easily manage user, group and machine accounts stored in
    an LDAP directory over a web interface. At the moment it supports:

      - managing user/group/host/domain entries
      - filtering and sorting
      - account profiles
      - multiple configuration profiles
      - tree viwer
      - schema browser
      - OU Editor
      - account creation via file upload
      - PDF export for all accounts
      - manage user/group Quota and create home directories

  Important:
    The default password to edit the configuration options is "lam".

  Installation:
    Please see the INSTALL file.

  Documentation:
    Basic documentation is available in the directory "docs".

  Upgrade from older versions:
    See docs/README.upgrade.txt for upgrade instructions.

  Internationalisation:
    If you want to use a translated version of LAM be sure to install the
    needed locales. See the LAM "locale" directory for a list of supported locales and languages.
    You can get a list of all installed locales on your sysem by executing: locale -a
    Debian users can add locales with "dpkg-reconfigure locales".

  Security:
    It is strongly recommended to use a SSL connection to your web server.

    LAM needs to store your LDAP user name + password in the session. The session
    files are saved in sess/ and are accessible only by the web server. To increase
    security username and password are encrypted with MCrypt/AES if available.
    The key and IV are generated at random when you log in. They are stored in two
    cookies.
