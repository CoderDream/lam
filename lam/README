LAM - Readme
============

  A set of PHP-scripts to administrate entries of a LDAP server. User, group and
  samba accounts can be displayed, searched, filtered, added, removed and edited
  over an easy to use web interface. Even the configuration options are
  embedded in the interface. Access to the interface is routed through the LDAP
  server.
