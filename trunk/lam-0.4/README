LAM - Readme
============

  A set of PHP-scripts to administrate Unix and Samba accounts in an LDAP server.
  LAM runs on any webserver with PHP4 support and connects to your LDAP server
  unencrypted or via SSL.
  The application manages accounts for users, groups and Samba hosts in
  multiple organizational units. LAM supports the Samba 2.x schema and the
  Samba 3 schema.

  Requirements:
    PHP4
    Openldap (2.0 or greater)
    A web-browser that supports CSS (Netscape 4.x is not recommended)

  Summary:
    With LAM you can easily manage user, group and machine accounts stored in
    a LDAP server over a web interface. At the moment it supports:

      - displaying the user/group/host/domain entries
      - deleting entries
      - adding new entries
      - editing entries
      - filtering and sorting
      - account profiles
      - access management
      - multiple configuration profiles
      - OU Editor
      - User creation via file upload
      - Samba 2 and 3 schema support

  Important:
    The standard password to edit the configuration options is "lam".

  Download:
    You can get the newest version at http://sourceforge.net/projects/lam/

  Installation:
    Please see the INSTALL file.

  Documentation:
    Basic documentation is available in the directory "docs".

  Internationalization:
    If you want to use a translated version of LAM be sure to install the
    needed locales. See locale/ for a list of supported locales and languages.
    Debian users can add locales with "dpkg-reconfigure locales".

  Security:
    It is strongly recommended to use a SSL connection to your web server.

    LAM needs to store your LDAP username + password in the session. The session
    files are saved in sess/ and are accessible only by the web server. To increase
    security username and password are encrypted with MCrypt/AES or Blowfish.
    The key and IV are generated at random when you log in. They are stored in two
    cookies.
 

    Have fun!
